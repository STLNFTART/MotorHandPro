## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

* GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
* Email communications with maintainers or contributors
* Project-related social media
* Conference presentations or papers based on this work
* Collaboration meetings (virtual or in-person)
* Any other forums where individuals represent the project

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at:

**Contact:** Donte Lightfoot (STLNFTART)
**Organization:** The Phoney Express LLC / Locked In Safety

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Confidentiality

Reports will be handled with discretion. Details may be shared with other maintainers or advisors on a need-to-know basis, but the reporter's identity will be protected.

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Special Considerations for Research Community

### Academic Collaboration
