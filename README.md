# MotorHandPro

High-precision robotic hand control and analysis framework integrating Primal Logic kernels, quantum-inspired actuator dynamics, and Optimus-grade motion profiling.

## Ec Definition
`Ec(t)` is the signed control energy functional derived from joint-state deviation:
\[
E_c(t) = \int_0^t \psi(\tau)\gamma(\tau)\,d\tau
\]
It serves as a Lyapunov-like metric ensuring bounded convergence under Lipschitz constant < 1.

## Primal Logic Control Kernel
Implements a contractive update law enforcing clustered zero-crossings and stable limit cycles for ψ–γ coupling.
